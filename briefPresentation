  Hi, I'm Jo√£o. I'm studying computer science and this repository will be only for codes related to my classes. I write in english, though I majorly speak portuguese, to practice.
I could, and probably will, write in other languages later for the same reason, so don't expect every file to have a version of any specific language (at least for now). 
Programming was introduced to me a few years ago, back in 2023. I was still looking for what graduation I would seek after high school, and this is the choice I've made.
I don't know if it's possible for anyone to comment on my posts since I just recently started using github for real, but I would gladly accept any hints you might want to give me.
  So far I've taken a liking to game development and software engineering.
